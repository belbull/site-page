I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Stanford University, where I am advisded by two awesome advisors - Michael Bernstein and James Landay. I am passionate about exploring **how we design systems that better support the varied experiences of different communities.**

Currently, my research approaches this interest by exploring design metaphors. Design metaphors shape the intended user experiences of our systems. We strive for _town square_-like social media platforms or _assistant_-like LLMs. Yet how do we know if these metaphors reflect users' actual experiences? What are the design tradeoffs that we make when we strive for such metaphors and how do these tradeoffs impact communities? What happens when we consider new metaphors for design or build around multiple metaphors? **Within my work, I look to see how we can use design metaphors as both a design and measurement tool** to shed light on users' varied experiences, highlight when intended user experiences do not translate to users' experiences, and provide new design inspiration for more equitable and pluralistic systems.

Beyond design metaphors, I have also explored how we can improve design through research around diverse online communities, algorithmic equity, and computer science ethics education. I am grateful to have worked on these topics alongside researchers at USAID, Spotify, and Adobe. Furthermore, this work has been made possible through generous support from the [HPI and Stanford HAI Ph.D. Fellowship](https://hpi.de/en/research/academic-partnerships/stanford-university/), the [Philanthropy and Civil Society Ph.D. Fellowship](https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/about/people/#filter=.filter_ph-d-fellows__2024-25), [CCSRE's Tech and Racial Equity Graduate Fellowship](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/research-institute/technology-racial-equity-initiative/technology-racial-equity-graduate-fellowship), the [GEM Ph.D. Science Fellowship](https://www.gemfellowship.org/), the [Siebel Scholar Award](https://www.siebelscholars.com/).

Prior to Stanford, I earned an MS in CS at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign where I was advised by the wonderful Karrie Karahalios.
